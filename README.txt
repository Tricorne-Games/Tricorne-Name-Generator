ABOUT

Ever needed to come up with a name for your RPG character or that region in your novel's world, but you just couldn't find something that rolls off your tongue right?

That's what this program is for. Simple taps of the Enter key, and the variety of combinations for names that show will be sure to jog your mind some more, and pick that perfect name.



HOW IT WORKS

It selects one, two, or three whole names (an effect to appear like a full name, but you can pick and pry). Using that, it sorts through the alphabet's vowels and consonants to make sure you get a cohesive pronounced sound to your names, instead of a 100% random jumble of letters.

All you do is tap the Enter key. That's it. If you want to quit, just type in 'Q', and hit Enter.
